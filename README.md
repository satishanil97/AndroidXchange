an app to keep track of lended and borrowed items

the lending part is working fine but trying to display all lended items in a listview crashes the app
Lended.java handles the displaying part
 
- DatabaseHelper is a class to aid in using sqli database -
- the fields that are stored in the table are name of borrower , item name & item type - 
- The borrowing part is not done yet -
